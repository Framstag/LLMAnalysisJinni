## Goal

Identify all used programming languages

## Solution strategy

Scan the repository for files typical for a programming language.
Sum up all found programming languages.

## Hints

* You can iteratively use the "GetFilesOverview" tool using wildcards specific for a programming language.
* Use a call for each module root.
* Make use you use a *high* value for "depth" like 15 to make sure you will see the code files.
* Analyse the given facts, to make a good guess, which programming languages might be used
to avoid scanning for all of them.

Here is a table that maps programming languages to glob expression

|Programming language|Glob Expression  |
|--------------------|-----------------|
|Java                | *.java          |
|Kotlin              | *.kt            |
|Javascript          | *.js            |
|Typescript          | *.ts            |
|C++                 | *.(h|hpp|cpp|cc)|

## Facts

The following build systems have been identified:

[# th:each="buildsystem : ${state.build.buildsystems}" th:remove="tag"]
* [(${buildsystem.name})]
[/]

The following build modules have been identified:

[# th:each="module : ${state.modules.modules}" th:remove="tag"]
* "[(${module.path})]"
[/]

The README names the following preconditions for build:

"[(${state.project.preconditionBuild})]"

The README names the following preconditions for execution:

"[(${state.project.preconditionRun})]"
