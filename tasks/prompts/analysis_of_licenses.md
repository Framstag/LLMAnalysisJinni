## Goal

Based on the loaded SBOM I expect from you a summary of all used licenses.
I also expect an analysis, if any of the licences are critical to use in a commercial
environment.

## Solution strategy

Get a list of Licenses by calling the SBOM tool, identify the licenses are return the evaluation summary afterward.

## Hints

* There is SBOM tool that lists you all licences found in the SBOM of all direct and transitive
  dependencies.
