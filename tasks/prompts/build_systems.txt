## Current Goal

* I want you to name the build systems used in the project.
* Return a list of all build systems you have identified.

## Solution strategy

* To identify a build system used in the project you should iteratively search
  for files that are representative for a given build system.
* Make a separate call for each build system you may have in mind until you find the
  files you are looking for.

## Hints

* To look fort certain file use the 'FindMatchingFiles' tool. Pass to it a glob expression
  to look for these files.
* For the following build systems I can give you the relevant file patterns:
  * Maven: "{,**/}pom.xml"
  * Gradle Classic: "{,**/}*.gradle"
  * Gradle Kotlin: "{,**/}*.gradle.kts"
