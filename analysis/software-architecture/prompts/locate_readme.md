## Current Goal

* Most applications have some kind of README containing project information in the root directory
of the project. I want you to locate this README and return it file name to me.

## Solution strategy

* Look for such files in the root directory of the project.
* Return the most likely filename.

## Hints

* You can call the 'GetAllFilesInDir' tool function to scan for READMEs in the root directory.
